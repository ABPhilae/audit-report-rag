INTERNAL AUDIT REPORT
Report Reference: IA-2025-Q3-APAC-001
Date: September 30, 2025
Region: APAC
Audit Type: Trade Reconciliation
Severity Classification: Critical
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Q3 2025 audit of APAC trade reconciliation processes identified 3 critical findings
and 4 medium findings. The most significant issues relate to control breakdowns in
the Hong Kong office's end-of-day reconciliation process.
 
FINDING 1: CRITICAL — TRADE RECONCILIATION DELAY
Finding Title: End-of-Day Reconciliation Delay Exceeding SLA
Severity: Critical
Region: Hong Kong
Responsible Party: Operations Team — Michael Chen
Deadline: December 31, 2025
Description: The front-office trade booking system showed a systematic 3-day delay
in reconciliation with the back-office settlement records. This represents a breach
of the 24-hour reconciliation SLA established in the Operations Policy v3.2.
Root Cause: Manual data entry process between the legacy TradeStar system and
the new Atlas settlement platform. No automated interface exists.
Recommendation: Implement automated API reconciliation between TradeStar and Atlas.
Estimated effort: 3 months. Interim control: daily manual check by senior officer.
 
FINDING 2: CRITICAL — UNAUTHORIZED ACCOUNT ACCESS
Finding Title: Unreviewed Privileged Accounts in Settlement System
Severity: Critical
Region: Singapore
Responsible Party: IT Security — Priya Sharma
Deadline: November 30, 2025
Description: 47 privileged user accounts in the Atlas settlement system had not been
reviewed in over 12 months, in violation of the quarterly access review requirement.
Among these, 8 accounts belonged to former employees who had left the firm.
Root Cause: Manual quarterly review process not completed due to team restructuring.
Recommendation: Automate access review using the existing IAM system. Immediately
revoke all 8 former employee accounts.
 
FINDING 3: MEDIUM — DOCUMENTATION GAPS
Finding Title: Incomplete Trade Amendment Documentation
Severity: Medium
Region: Hong Kong
Responsible Party: Compliance — Sarah Wong
Deadline: February 28, 2026
Description: 23% of trade amendments reviewed lacked proper dual-authorisation
documentation. While the authorisation itself occurred in the system, paper trail
documentation was incomplete for regulatory purposes.
Recommendation: Implement mandatory documentation checklist in the system.
