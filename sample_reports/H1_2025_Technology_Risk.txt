INTERNAL AUDIT REPORT
Report Reference: IA-2025-H1-TECH-001
Date: June 30, 2025
Region: Global
Audit Type: Technology Risk Assessment
Severity Classification: High
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The H1 2025 technology risk audit covered 5 critical systems across all regions.
Key concerns include backup and recovery gaps, software patch management, and
third-party vendor access controls.
 
FINDING 1: CRITICAL — BACKUP RECOVERY FAILURE
Finding Title: No Disaster Recovery Testing in 6 Months
Severity: Critical
Region: Global
Responsible Party: IT Infrastructure — James Liu
Deadline: September 30, 2025
Description: The annual disaster recovery test has not been performed for 6 months,
exceeding the 3-month testing requirement in the IT Policy Framework.
The last test revealed a 4-hour recovery time, but the current target is 2 hours.
Root Cause: Team capacity constraints due to system migration project.
Recommendation: Schedule and complete full DR test within 60 days. Document results.
 
FINDING 2: HIGH — PATCH MANAGEMENT
Finding Title: Critical Security Patches Not Applied Within SLA
Severity: High
Region: APAC
Responsible Party: IT Security — Priya Sharma
Deadline: August 31, 2025
Description: 12 servers running critical banking applications had not received
security patches within the mandatory 30-day window. Three of these patches
addressed critical CVE vulnerabilities rated 9.0+ on the CVSS scale.
Recommendation: Implement automated patch deployment with exception reporting.
 
FINDING 3: MEDIUM — VENDOR ACCESS
Finding Title: Third-Party Vendor Remote Access Without MFA
Severity: Medium
Region: Europe
Responsible Party: IT Security — Thomas Bernard
Deadline: October 31, 2025
Description: 3 third-party vendors supporting core banking systems accessed the
network via VPN without multi-factor authentication. This creates risk of
credential compromise affecting critical systems.
Recommendation: Mandate MFA for all third-party remote access immediately.
